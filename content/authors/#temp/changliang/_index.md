Changliang Wang received a Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Macau in 2020. Subsequently, he joined the Bioisland Laboratory and the Guangzhou National Laboratory as an assistant researcher, focusing on integrative analysis of multi-omics data such as single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq), and spatial transcriptomics, as well as the development of interactive bioinformatics visualization platforms. He joined Yu lab as a assistant researcher in June, 2025 and his research interests include lncRNA encoding micro-peptide identification and deep learning models for integration peptide-MHC-TCR-scRNA.
