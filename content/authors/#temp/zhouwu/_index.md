Liu Zhouwu graduated from Sun Yat-sen University with a Master’s degree, specializing in medical image intelligent analysis, deep learning, computer vision, and software system architecture design. His research interests include medical image algorithm analysis, anomaly detection, and out-of-distribution detection. Since joining the laboratory, he has primarily focused on large-scale model algorithm research, particularly in using deep learning models for predicting DNA mutation effects and analyzing the correlation between genotype and phenotype. He hopes these models will play a crucial role in future biological research.
