Dr. Maoni Guo earned her Ph.D. in Biomedicine from the University of Macau in June 2022. Her doctoral research focused on the genomics and genetics of human cancers, particularly breast cancer, using bioinformatics and multi-omics integration. She published her work as the first author in journals such as Cancers (2019), Front Cell Dev Biol (2021), and Cells (2022). Following her Ph.D., Dr. Guo joined Dr. Xuepeng Chen's lab at the Guangzhou National Laboratory for postdoctoral research, where she focuses on the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (scRNA-seq, ST) and chromatin conformation (scHi-C, spatial Hi-C) data. Her research explores the application of spatial Hi-C in mouse embryogenesis and brain development, as well as spatial multi-omics in lung adenocarcinoma. In August 2025, she will join Dr. Fulong Yu's lab as an Assistant Researcher, where her work will focus on developing bioinformatics algorithms for identifying non-coding micropeptides and assessing the functional impact of mutations.
