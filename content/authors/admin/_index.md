I’m a Postdocteral Research Scientist at Harvard Medical School. My research interests are mainly in bioinformatics, single-cell genomics, deep learning, and human (epi)genetics.

I completed my Ph.D. of Bioinformatics from Harbin Medical University (2018). In early 2020, I joined in Guocheng Yuan lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Vijay Sankaran lab at Boston Children’s Hospital/Broad Institute as a research fellow, repectively, where I worked on algorithm and tool development in terms of single-cell genomics and human genetics.

I started my lab at the Guangzhou National Laboratory in 2022. Our research focuses on the development and innovation of algorithms, computational tools, and resources at the intersection of genomics and artificial intelligence.
