Zexu Jiang, from the School of Computer and Control Engineering at Qiqihar University, is currently an intern at Yu Lab. During his master's studies, he focused on the application of deep reinforcement learning in optimization problems and was dedicated to developing machine learning-based models for immune age prediction and aging assessment. He is about to join Yu Lab as a Ph.D. student, planning to conduct in-depth research at the intersection of deep learning and virus evolution. At present, his research focuses on virus evolution prediction, hoping to develop tools that support precision medicine. In his free time, he enjoys playing basketball.
