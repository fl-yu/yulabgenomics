## Tool:
- [**HemeMap**](https://github.com/sankaranlab/mecom_var) (*Nature Immunology*, 2022): A computational framework to identify putative cisREs and cell-type-specific cisRE-gene interactions by integrating multiomic data from 18 hematopoietic cell populations.
- [**SCAVENGE**](https://github.com/sankaranlab/SCAVENGE) (*Nature Biotechnology*, 2022): An R package for dentifying genetic trait/phenotype relevant cell type/state at single cell resolution.
- [**CUT&RUNTools 2.0**](https://github.com/fl-yu/CUT-RUNTools-2.0) (*Bioinformatics*, 2021): A tool for bulk and single-cell CUT&RUN/CUT&Tag data processing and analysis.

## Database:
- [**CMCA**](https://yulabgenomics.miracle.ac.cn:9066/cmca/home/): The Co-assayed Multimodal Cell Atlas (CMCA) gathers and organizes diverse co-assayed multimodal datasets, including measurements from single cells spanning the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome.
- [**CFEA**](http://www.bio-data.cn/CFEA/) (*Nucleic Acids Research*, 2020): A cell-free epigenome database dedicated to three types of widely adopted epigenetic modifications involved in 27 human diseases.
